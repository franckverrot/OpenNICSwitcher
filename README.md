# OpenNIC Switcher

OpenNIC Switcher is an OSX application that tries to make it easy using a
DNS server from the OpenNIC server list.

## What is OpenNIC

_(This section is a copy-paste from [the OpenNIC project wiki page][wikipage])_

    OpenNIC is a user controlled Network Information Center offering a democratic,
    non-national, alternative to the traditional Top-Level Domain registries. In
    case you were looking for them, traditonal TLDs are currently served by Network
    Solutions with policies set by ICANN.

    Use of OpenNIC DNS servers, will allow host name resolution in the Legacy U.S.
    Government DNS, OpenNIC operated namespaces, and those namespaces with which
    the OpenNIC has peering agreements.
